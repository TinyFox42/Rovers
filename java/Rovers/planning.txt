Don't know how java will handle me editing a file without the compiler open (I have no idea how the different files work), so I'll just plan here
The config setup:
  Config will have:
    Position scale (int can't handle 1.01, and I don't want to have to worry about floating point, so if scale is 100 then 1.01 would be 101)
    More stuff later
Ok, basic code for this (will need some other stuff to make it actually compile)
Based off of https://www.caveofprogramming.com/java/java-file-reading-and-writing-files-in-java.html 
//Start partial code
import java.io.*;//Import stuff needed to read files
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;//Stuff to make regexes work nicely
public class config{
  private int scale;
  public config(){
    String filename="config.txt";
    try{
      FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(filename);
      BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
      String line=null;
      while((line=bufferedReader.readLine())!=null){
        processLine(line);//This still needs to be coded
      }
      bufferedReader.close();
    catch(FileNotFoundException ex){
      System.out.println("config.txt could not be opened. Switching to default values.");
      useDefault();//Also needs to be coded
    }
    catch(IOException ex){
      System.out.println("config.txt could not be read. Switching to default values.");
      useDefault();//Code this later on
    }
  }
  private void processLine(String line){
    if(line.matches("\\s*#.*")){
      //Ignore this line, #'s are comments
    }
    else{
      Pattern pattern=Pattern.compile("\\s*(\\w+)\\s*=\\s*(\\d+).*");
      Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(line);
      //Ok, running low on time
      //look it up later
    }
